![A tree](/assets/tree.png)

Approximately back in 2019 I gave a presentation to a group of bootcamp's students learning to become frontend developers. Major part of it was half-baked and not that memorable. However, the opening point was quite good. Some of the audience had commented on it afterwards expressing their liking of it. Another sign of it being decent is observing reactions of both my coworkers at the time and prospective employer's interviewers.

It was presented in form of metaphor to make it easy to comprehend, retain and recall. Fun and kind of dark humor at the same time is the task I picked to use case it, looking for a nice image to complement a story made me sad about us/humanity. Hence, chosen image is of a _cartoon_ tree alone ðŸ˜… (with no lumberjacks or saws next to it)

# (The metaphor of) software engineer maturity levels

### Junior
A product owner comes to a developer and says:
- I need to cut down a tree
- No problem, I'm on it - replies the developer and goes absent/missing for a while. He returns after some time proudly announcing that the task is done
- Where is the tree? - asks product owner
- Oh, yeah, it's in the forest, you can pick it up from there.
- Okay, thanks!

### Medium
A product owner comes to a developer and says:
- I need to cut down a tree
- What kind of tree do you need? What about its size/height/volume?
- Trunk diameter is 300mm, height is 5 meters
- How much time do I have?
- No rush, a couple of days  
- Where do you want me to bring it once it's cut down?
- It's fine to leave it at the spot
- Any instruments/equipment I could use to perform the task?
- Sure thing, here they are

..
... After a couple of days
..
- Task is done - reports the developer
- Great, thanks!

### Senior
A product owner comes to a developer and says:
- I need to cut down a tree
- Why do you need it?
- I need to cross the river over there
- Okay, in that case feel free to use that bridge in here for this purpose
- Thanks!
